# Spyro Shuffler
This is a plugin for Bizhawk Shuffler for use with games featuring Spyro the Dragon.
The plugin is designed mainly to swap games whenever a collectable is obtain by the player (gems, dragons, orbs, eggs, etc) but can also sync collectables between games.

I mainly gave it a shot one day after somebody made a joke of doing it for a race and I thought "Why not?"

# Supported games
The following games are supported by the plug-in:

* Spyro the Dragon (NTSC)
* Spyro the Dragon (NTSC - Japan)
* Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage (NTSC)
* Spyro: Year of the Dragon (NTSC - Greatest Hits)

Additional games may be added in the future.

# Features

The plug-in does the following:

* Syncs gems across games
* Updates the HUD to show global gem total
* Triggers a game swap when a threshold is reached (Ex. gem collected is 5 or higher)

Additional collectables for both syncing and swapping are planned.
